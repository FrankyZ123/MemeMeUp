### MemeMeUp

This is a fun program to have running during all nighters / mindless tasks. It pulls memes from funnyjunk.com and opens them in your default browser at a user specific time.

I recommend setting up a bash_profile alias, mine looks something like:

```bash
alias memes='cd ~/path/to/MemeMeUp/dir && python3 MemeMeUp.py
```
